# This file is sourced by /etc/init.d/lm_sensors and defines the modules to
# be loaded/unloaded.
#
# The format of this file is a shell script that simply defines variables:
# HWMON_MODULES for hardware monitoring driver modules, and optionally
# BUS_MODULES for any required bus driver module (for example for I2C or SPI).

HWMON_MODULES="coretemp"

# For compatibility reasons, modules are also listed individually as variables
#    MODULE_0, MODULE_1, MODULE_2, etc.
# You should use BUS_MODULES and HWMON_MODULES instead if possible.

MODULE_0=coretemp
