This is my repository of package lists that I install on my Arch Linux
machines.  You won't find anything outre' or interesting here, I put them
here so I can reconstruct my boxen in a hurry if I need to.

These lists were created with Backpac (https://github.com/altercation/backpac),
which I installed from the AUR.  It seems pretty cool so far, and I can
probably use this to recreate my machines in a hurry if I need to.
